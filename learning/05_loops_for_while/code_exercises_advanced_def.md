### CLI Menu
- "Write a Python program that repeatedly displays a menu to the user and performs one of the following tasks based on the user's choice:  
    1. Print all even numbers up to a given number N.
    2. Calculate and print the sum and average of N user-entered numbers.
    3. Check whether a given number is a perfect number.
    4. Exit the program. 

    The program should continue to display the menu after each operation until the user chooses to exit. Ensure to handle invalid inputs gracefully by prompting the user again."

```

### Calculator
- "Write a Python program that repeatedly asks the user to input two numbers and an operator, performs the arithmetic operation, and displays the result. The program should continue until the user decides to stop.  
1. The operations supported should be addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
2. If the user enters invalid numbers or an invalid operator, the program should display an error message and prompt again.
3. The program should handle division by zero gracefully.
4. If the result is a whole number (e.g., 5.0), it should be displayed as an integer (e.g., 5)."
```

### Guess the Number Game
Write a Python program to let the user guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20.
Generate the number using random.randint(1, 20).
- Repeatedly prompt the user to guess.
- After each guess, print:  
    "Too low!" for guess less than the number.  
    "Too high!" for guess greater than the number.  
    "Congratulations!." if correct.  
Continue until the user guesses correctly.
```
import random
def guess_result(val, num):
    if val < num:
        return "Too low!"
    elif val > num:
        return "Too high!"
    else:
        return "Congratulations! You guessed it."

def main():
    number = random.randint(1, 20)
    print("Guess the number between 1 and 20!")
    guess = 0
    while guess != number:
        guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
        print(guess_result(guess,number))

### Simple Banking Simulator
Write a Python program that simulates simple banking actions:
- Start with a balance of 0.
- Repeatedly show a menu with options to:  
     Deposit money &nbsp; Withdraw money &nbsp; Check balance  &nbsp; Exit  
- For deposit/withdraw, prompt for amount and update balance accordingly.
- Show an error for invalid inputs or if withdrawal amount is more than balance.
- Keep running until the user chooses to exit.

```
def deposit(balance, amount):
    if amount > 0:
        balance += amount
        print(f"Deposited: {amount}")
    else:
        print("Invalid amount.")
    return balance

    if 0 < amount <= balance:
        balance -= amount
        print(f"Withdrew: {amount}")

    print("\n1. Deposit")
    print("2. Withdraw")
    print("3. Check Balance")
    print("4. Exit")

### Two-Player Dice Game
Write a Python program to simulate a simple two-player dice game using only basic programming concepts: loops, conditionals, variables, and user input. Do not use functions (def) or advanced Python features.
<details>
<summary>Game rules</summary>

- The game is played between two players.  
- On a player's turn, they roll a six-sided die (values from 1 to 6).  
- If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends immediately and they earn 0 points for that turn.
- If they roll any other number (2â€“6), that number is added to their turn score.
- After each roll (except when it is 1), the player can choose to:  
    - Roll again, or
    - Hold, which ends their turn and adds the turn score to their total score.
- The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds 30 points, and that player is declared the winner.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Requirements</summary>

Your program must:
Use only:
- `while` loops  
- `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements  
- Variables  
- `print()` and `input()` functions  
- `random.randint()` from the `random` module  
Do not use:
- Lists, dictionaries, classes, or any other imports besides `random`  

Additional Requirements:
- Alternate turns between Player 1 and Player 2  
- Display the current score after each turn  
- Display a final message announcing the winner
</details>
