# Python Learning and DSA Practice

This repository marks the beginning of my journey to learn **Python** from the ground up and gradually dive into more complex **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

##  Learning Goals

My first focus is to build a solid foundation in Python by learning and practicing the following:
1. Variables, Data Types  
2. Math operations
3. Conditional Statements (if-else)  
4. Loops (for, while)  
5. collections ( Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dicts)
6. Functions  
7. Exception Handling (try-except)  
8. Working with Files (reading/writing)  
9. Object-Oriented Programming (classes and objects)

Once I am confident in the basics, I will move on to solving problems and implementing:

-  Arrays, Strings
-  Algorithmic Problem Solving (Leetcodes, etc.)

## Timeline

This repository is structured to reflect my learning  — from Python basics to advanced DSA topics — showcasing progress and deeper understanding over time.

Stay tuned as I learn and grow!
## Extra Cheat Sheets

To support my learning journey, I’ve added some handy cheat sheets under the [`extra/`](extra/) folder:

- **Linux Basics Cheat Sheet** — Essential commands for navigating and managing files in the Linux terminal.
- **Git Basics Cheat Sheet** — Core Git commands to help with version control and collaboration.
- **Markdown Cheat Sheet** — Quick reference for writing clean and effective Markdown.
